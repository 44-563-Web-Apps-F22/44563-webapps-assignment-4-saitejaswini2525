        <h3>Iolanthe</h3>
        <h4>ACT-1</h4>
        <h5>SCENE.—An Arcadian Landscape.  A river runs around the back of the
            stage.  A rustic bridge crosses the river.
          
            Enter Fairies, led by Leila, Celia, and Fleta.  They trip around
            the stage, singing as they dance.</h5>
        <p>CHORUS.</p>
        <p>Tripping hither, tripping thither,<br>
            Nobody knows why or whither;<br>
            We must dance and we must sing<br>
            Round about our fairy ring!</p>

        <p>SOLO—CELIA.</p>

        <p>We are dainty little fairies,<br>
            Ever singing, ever dancing;<br>
       We indulge in our vagaries<br>
            In a fashion most entrancing.<br>
       If you ask the special function<br>
            Of our never-ceasing motion,<br>
       We reply, without compunction,<br>
            That we haven't any notion!</p>
        
        <p>CHORUS.</p>

        <p>No, we haven't any notion!
            Tripping hither, etc.</p>

        <p> SOLO—LEILA.</p>

        <p>If you ask us how we live,<br>
            Lovers all essentials give—<br>
                 We can ride on lovers' sighs,<br>
                 Warm ourselves in lovers' eyes,<br>
                 Bathe ourselves in lovers' tears,<br>
                 Clothe ourselves with lovers' fears,<br>
                 Arm ourselves with lovers' darts,<br>
                 Hide ourselves in lovers' hearts.<br>
            When you know us, you'll discover<br>
            That we almost live on lover!</p>
        
        <h6>>CELIA. </h6>  <p> Ah, it's all very well, but since our Queen banished
            Iolanthe, fairy revels have not been what they were!</p>
        <h6>LEILA. </h6> <p> Iolanthe was the life and soul of Fairyland.  Why, she
            wrote all our songs and arranged all our dances!  We sing her songs
            and we trip her measures, but we don't enjoy ourselves!</p>
        <h6>FLETA.</h6>  <p>To think that five-and-twenty years have elapsed since
            she was banished!  What could she have done to have deserved so
            terrible a punishment?</p>
        <h6>LEILA.</h6>  <p>Something awful!  She married a mortal!</p>
        <h6>FLETA.</h6>  <p>Oh!  Is it injudicious to marry a mortal?</p>
        <h6>LEILA.</h6>  <p>Injudicious?  It strikes at the root of the whole</p>
        <h6>QUEEN.</h6>  <p> No, because your Queen, who loved her with a
            surpassing love, commuted her sentence to penal servitude for life,
            on condition that she left her husband and never communicated with
            him again!</p>
